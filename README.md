# giphy_api
Basic single-page application using jQuery, AJAX and the Giphy API  <br/>   
This app will take in a search input, query the Giphy API for related GIFs using an AJAX call. GIFs received in the response object are then rendered in the DOM with the respective rating. Finally, the user may pause or unpause each GIF by clicking on it. This is done with the use of an event handler changing the GIF's data-state from "still" to "animate" and vice versa on each click.
